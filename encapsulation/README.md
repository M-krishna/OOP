# Encapsulation example

Definition: Bundling of data with the methods that operate on the data, or restricting direct access to some of an objects components.
### Real world example
Cola Machine

A Cola machine contains different varieties and types of cola that a user can choose from. There is some sort of mechanism to get a cola that a user choose from the machine.
In the code example we'll design a Cola machine that a user can access and choose from.

Here we create a `ColaMachine` class that contains data members and functions encapsulated together. Some of them are public and some of them are private. This achieves Encapsulation.
